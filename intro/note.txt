NumPy
	- numpy.random.randint(low, how=None, size = Noe, dtype='l')

Basic Data Processing with Pandas
	- Pandas data tool kits, open source
	- Help to learn Pandas: Stack Overflow; books: Python for Data Analysis( by O'Reilly ), Learning the Pandas library (by Matt Harrison); Planet Python (http://planetpython.org); data Skeptic Podcast (http://dataskeptic.com)
	- The series is one of the core data structures in pandas.
	- How pandas' series can be created : can be created from dictionary data, index is automatically assigned to the keys of the dictionary that you provided and not just incrementing integers

vectorization
	- Pandas and the underlying NumPy libraries support a method of computation called vectorization
	- Sum method
	- faster 
Related feature in Pandas and NumPy is called broadcasting. With broadcasting, you can apply an operation to every value in the series, changing the series.

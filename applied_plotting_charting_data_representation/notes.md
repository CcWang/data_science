#Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

## Principles of Information Visualization

### Visualization Wheel Dimensions (five dimensions)

	1. Abstraction - Figuration
	A highly figurative visual describes the phenomenon using physical representations of the phenomena, such as photographs or drawings. As the representations become less real and more conceptual, the emphasis shifts from figuration to abstraction. 
		* Boxes and charts(abstraction) or real-world physical objects (figuration)
		
	2. Functionality - Decoration
	 A completely functional graphic has no embellishments and is closer to a direct representation of the data. 
		* No embellishments (functionality) or artistic embellishments(decoration)
		
	3. Density - Lightness
	they related to the amounts of data shown
		* Must be studied in depth (density) or understandable at a glance (lightness)
		
	4. Multidimensional - Unidimensional
		* Different aspects of phenomena (multidimensional) or single or few items of phenomena(unidimensional)
		
	5. Originality  - Familiarity
	
### Graphical heuristics: Data-ink ratio (Edward Tufte)
A heuristic is a process or rule that is meant to guide you in decision making.

Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic.  The non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented. In other words, the data-ink is essential to the sense-making process for a given variable. 

减少不必要的信息(only leave information that help user to analyze the data)

### Qualities of a good visualization
	1. truthful
		* We have two obligations when it comes to protecting the truth: a.  be honest with ourselves when we clean and summarize data (do not misleading yourself); b. to our audience: (do not misleading your audience)
	
	2. Functionality
	
	3. Beauty
	
	4. Insightful
	
	5. Enlightening
		* A combination of the previous four, but with a social ethical responsibility
